# odin-recipes
a basic recipe website

This project utilizes introductory HTML lessons in creating a basic food recipe website. Each recipe page will contain the name of the food and its picture, a brief description, the ingredients needed, and finally, the steps in making it. In completing this project, basic HTML skills would have been demonstrated - skills such as writing boilerplate HTML, use of divisions in separating various sections, linking between pages and sites, use of images, lists (ordered and unordered), and basic text styles. In doing this project, other vital skills in development were learned such as the use of git and github in setting up the repository, pushing commits, and deploying the website; VScode and the terminal were other technology used in completing this project.
